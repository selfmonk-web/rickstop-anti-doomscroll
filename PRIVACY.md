# Privacy Policy — RickStop

Last updated: 2026/01/13

## Summary
RickStop is designed to be privacy-first. It does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data. The extension works locally in your browser to detect doomscrolling patterns and optionally lock supported sites for a short period.

## Data We Collect
**None.**  
RickStop does not collect:
- Personal information (name, email, identifiers)
- Browsing history logs
- Page content
- Messages, posts, comments, or form inputs

## Data We Store (Local Only)
RickStop stores a small amount of settings and state **locally on your device** using Chrome’s extension storage:
- Lock state (per-host lock-until timestamp)
- Settings (lock minutes, sensitivity level, whitelist, toggles)
- Local-only stats (e.g., “minutes saved”, streak)

This data never leaves your device.

## Network Requests
RickStop does not send analytics or telemetry.  
The only external navigation is when you voluntarily click the **Buy Me a Coffee** link, which opens in a new tab.

## Permissions Explained
- **storage**: saves your settings, lock timers, and local stats.
- **host_permissions** (specific sites): allows the content script to run on supported social domains so it can detect scroll patterns and show the lock overlay.

## Third-Party Services
RickStop does not integrate with third-party analytics, trackers, or backends.

## Security
All logic runs locally. No accounts. No remote servers. No data uploads.

## Changes to This Policy
If this policy changes, the “Last updated” date will be revised and the new policy will be published in this repository.
