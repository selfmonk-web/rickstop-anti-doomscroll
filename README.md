# rickstop-anti-doomscroll
RickStop is a privacy-first Chrome extension that detects doomscrolling patterns on major social sites and enforces a hard lock (default 10 minutes). Includes optional soft nudges, 20 sensitivity levels, a “slow-scroll” bypass guard, local-only time-saved stats, and whitelist rules. Manifest V3. No accounts, no analytics, no remote servers.
